            <h2>Why Kampala?</h2>
            <h3>Kampala, the city on seven hills</h3>
            <p>
              The name "Kampala" comes from the local language, Luganda, and
              translates to "For Impala." This name is derived from the presence
              of the impala antelope species in the area. In the early 19th
              century, Frederick Lugard established a fort on Old Kampala Hill,
              which was home to several impalas at that time, leading to the
              city's name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kampala is situated in central Uganda, within the Buganda region,
              and is partly located along the shores of Lake Victoria. The city
              is famously known as the "City of Seven Hills" because it
              originally encompassed seven hills: Mengo, Rubaga, Namirembe,
              Makerere, Kololo, Nakasero, and Old Kampala Hill. Today, however,
              greater Kampala extends across at least 21 hills.
